title: "Templar: Using SQL Query Logs in Text-to-SQL"
excerpt: "Several lines of research have attempted to construct natural language interfaces to databases (NLIDBs) which can convert natural language queries (NLQ) to SQL. Several challenges exist in this translation process, and we believe that using information from a SQL query log, which is often readily available for existing databases, can assist a NLIDB in matching a NLQ to the most likely SQL interpretation."

Several lines of research have attempted to construct natural language interfaces to databases (NLIDBs) which can convert natural language queries (NLQ) to SQL. Several challenges exist in this translation process, and we believe that using information from a SQL query log, which is often readily available for existing databases, can assist a NLIDB in matching a NLQ to the most likely SQL interpretation.
