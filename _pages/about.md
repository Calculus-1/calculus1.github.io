I am a Postdoctoral Scholar at the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington, mentored by [Prof. Ras Bodik](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~bodik/). My current research is on developing tools to help social scientists and other researchers build ontologies and extract semantic data from the Web without extensive programming training.

Before that, I obtained my PhD from the University of Michigan, co-advised by [Prof. Mike Cafarella](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~michjc/index.html) and [Prof. H. V. Jagadish](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~jag/) in the [Database Research Group](http://dbgroup.eecs.umich.edu). My PhD research was on helping users query relational databases more easily without needing to learn complex languages like SQL.

I am a believer in Jesus Christ, happily married to my wife Sharon since 2017, and in my spare time enjoy trying new foods and writing [Yelp reviews](https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=NWQyHedzeZUccPY2f5vRBQ), playing acoustic guitar, basketball, and [reading books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19711018-chris-baik). I love Michigan football (and to a lesser extent, basketball) and hence will be generally preoccupied on Saturdays in the fall season.
