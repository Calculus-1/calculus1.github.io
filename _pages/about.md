I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Michigan. I am co-advised by [Prof. Mike Cafarella](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~michjc/index.html) and [Prof. H. V. Jagadish](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~jag/) in the [Database Research Group](http://dbgroup.eecs.umich.edu). My current research interests are in database usability, where the goal is to help users query databases more easily without needing to learn complex languages like SQL.

I graduated from the University of Michigan with a B.S.E. in Computer Science in 2011. I worked a couple years following that as a web developer and the first employee of a startup, Seelio (acquired by Keypath Education, now defunct), before starting in my PhD program in the fall of 2014.

I am a believer in Jesus Christ, happily married to my wife Sharon since 2017, an active member of [Harvest Mission Community Church](http://hmcc.net), and in my spare time, enjoy trying new foods, writing [Yelp reviews](https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=NWQyHedzeZUccPY2f5vRBQ), playing acoustic guitar, basketball, and [reading books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19711018-chris-baik). I love Michigan football (and to a lesser extent, basketball) and hence will be generally preoccupied on Saturdays in the fall season.
